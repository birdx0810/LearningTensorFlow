This directory holds the code implementation of some functions used in deep learning that are implemented using NumPy and also the implementation of some basic models using TensorFlow (v1), Keras (TF2.0), and PyTorch for Deep Learning in text, audio, and image. 

Models implemented include:
- Intro (NumPy)
    - [ ] Activation functions
    - [ ] Loss functions
    - [ ] Similarity/distance functions
- Basic (TF, Keras, PyTorch)
    - [ ] MLP for tabular data classification (Titanic)
    - [ ] RNN for text classification (Yelp Polarity)
    - [ ] RNN for audio classification (YesNo)
    - [ ] CNN for time series classification (ECG5000)
    - [ ] CNN for image classification (CIFAR10)
- Advanced (PyTorch Only)
    - [ ] AttSeq2Seq for neural dialog generation
    - [ ] MIDI-VAE for music style transfer
    - [ ] DCGAN for synthetic image generation
